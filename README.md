Hi there 👋

I'm Julia Souza, welcome to my profile!

A little bit about me:

- 📚 I'm a student at UNIP – Universidade Paulista.
- 💻 I develop college projects where I can test what I’m learning.
- 🌱 I’m focused on studying programming logic, and I’ve been practicing with Python and C, languages I studied last semester.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with C — it’s been kind of tough for me, and I still have some difficulties, which I'm working on it!!
- 📫 You can reach me by email at juliaslvsouza@gmail.com or via my LinkedIn profile: /juliaslvsouza.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Corinthians fan! VAI CORINTHIANS!! 🖤🤍

Well, that's it for now. As I continue learning, I will keep this information updated.

Thank you for visiting my profile. - And if you're hiring, I'm available for an internship or a trainee position.
